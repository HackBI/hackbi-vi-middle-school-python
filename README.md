## Definition: 
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability. It utilizes structured, object-oriented and functional programming.


## Goal: 
Teach the participants the basics of Python, specifically the Turtle module, in order to highlight the creativity in programming


## Get Started:
1. Open Trinket.io in your browser
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create new Python file
4. Explain Python basics and Turtle functions


## Basics:
* Brief overview of Python basics such as input, output, variables, loops, conditionals, and modules and how they are combined to create complex code
* More in-depth explanation of the Turtle module and its functions

## Challenges:
1. Calculate your age by entering your birthday (basics)
2. Write your full name using Turtle
3. Draw your favorite animal using Turtle


## Trinket.io:
* I think Trinket.io will be much easier to use as it is accessible through any browser
* Visual Studio Code is another option but I donâ€™t know if VSC and the Python extension are on every school computer.
